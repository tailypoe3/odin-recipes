            <li>3 tablespoons salted butter</li>

            <li>1 large carrot, chopped</li>
            <li>1 small yellow onion, chopped</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons poultry seasoning</li>
            <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 quart chicken stock</li>
            <li>2 medium white potatoes, peeled and chopped</li>
            <li>1 pint half-and-half</li>
            <li>1 cup frozen peas</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Directions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
                <li>Place biscuits on an ungreased baking sheet and sprinkle paprika on the 
                    tops.</li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 13 to 16 minutes.</li>
                <li>While the biscuits are baking, melt butter in a medium pot over medium or 
                    medium-high heat. Add chicken and cook until no longer pink, 5 to 7 minutes.
                    Add carrot, onion, poultry seasoning, salt, and pepper; cook until veggies 
                    have softened, about 5 minutes.</li>
                <li>Stir in flour and cook for 1 minute. Add chicken stock and potatoes; bring to a boil.
                    Reduce heat to a simmer. Add half-and-half and nutmeg; simmer for 10 minutes. Add frozen 
                    peas, green beans, and lima beans. Cook, stirring occasionally, until potatoes are tender
                    and frozen vegetables are heated through, 5 to 10 minutes.</li>
                <li>Serve immediately with a biscuit on top of each bowl.</li>
            </ol>
